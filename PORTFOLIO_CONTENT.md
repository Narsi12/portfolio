## 👤 ABOUT ME

### Friendly Yet Professional Introduction

I'm a dedicated Full Stack Software Engineer who transforms complex technical challenges into elegant, scalable solutions. My expertise lies in building high-performance backend systems, optimizing data pipelines, and leveraging cloud platforms to drive real business value.

**What I bring to the table:**
- **Problem-solver at heart:** I break down complex systems, identify bottlenecks, and implement solutions that improve efficiency by 25-75%
- **Ownership mentality:** I take end-to-end responsibility—from architecture to deployment to 24x7 monitoring
- **Impact-focused:** Every line of code I write is measured by its real-world impact: faster incident resolution, cost savings, or improved reliability
- **Continuous learner:** I stay ahead of the curve with AWS, Azure, Kubernetes, and emerging technologies

When I'm not coding, I share knowledge on Medium, contribute to open-source, and participate in hackathons (won AI.4 Hackathon at MouriTech!).

**Let's build something extraordinary together.**
